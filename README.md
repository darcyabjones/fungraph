# fungraph

This is a prototype pipeline for constructing and calling variants from pangenome graphs.

The software in this space is very new so it is unlikely to be stable.
The plan is to use [seqwish](https://github.com/ekg/seqwish) and/or [minigraph](https://github.com/lh3/minigraph) for construction,
and [VG](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) for variant calling.

I'm mostly interested in reference free structural variant calling and presence-absense detection.
We'll see what else we can do with it after that.
